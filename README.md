Greetings

Thank you for viewing my image slider! It was created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and was created as a part of a bigger project.

It's features include the following:

- cycles between 3 images automatically
- each image can be cycled via the previous or next buttons on each side of the slider
- each image can be specifically accessed via the 3 dots on the bottom middle of the slider which also cycle along side the images

This project is awaiting one update which will implement responsiveness, from there this project will be concluded.

If you wish to use the following code for any projects, please be sure to credit/reference me in your project.
